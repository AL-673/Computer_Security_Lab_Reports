Lab 3 : Encryption Application, and DOS malware. In this we learned the apache authentication methods, digital certificate, secure         authentication using HTTPSoSSL, analyze a DOS attack delivered using WORM. All this is done in Kali linux OS

Lab 4 : Managing Security Enhanced Linux. Introduced SELinux OS, and exposed secure computational enviorenment of cloud computing. 

Lab 5 : Container Virtualization for Windows. Getting familiar with the Docker container enviorenment, Experience the benefit of virtualization. s/w used was docker toolbox, and kali linux OS

Lab 6 : Operating System Auditing & Intrusion Detection System. In this we identified keywords of rules syntax, to sample the auditng process of Linux enviorenment. Intro to linux OS auditing. Some keywords : snort, ipvar, portvar, alert, payload, log, drop, reject, sdrop etc
